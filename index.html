        <h2 style="color: rgb(66, 133, 244)">About</h2>
        <p>
          Through my extensive experience as a gamer, specifically my
          decade-long engagement with League of Legends, I have developed an
          immense fascination with all facets of computing. The game's highly
          competitive environment and the continual need to acquire knowledge
          and skills every season have been instrumental in shaping my interest
          in the field. As a software engineer, I place significant emphasis on
          the importance of continuous learning and growth, and the famous maxim
          "The secret to mastery in any field is to forever be a student"
          attributed to Martin Palmer, serves as a guiding principle that
          resonates with me on a personal level.
        </p>

        <p>
          While I initially had to take a brief hiatus from college due to the
          COVID-19 pandemic, I did not let this setback deter me from pursuing
          my passion for coding. My time at App Academy, which culminated in my
          graduation in March 2023, has allowed me to hone my expertise in Ruby
          on Rails and React-Redux, and I am excited to leverage these
          proficiencies in a professional setting.
        </p>

        <p>
          In conclusion, I firmly believe that cultivating a balance of passion
          and coachability, along with effective communication, is the key to
          excelling as a software engineer. By embracing my passion for software
          development, continuously seeking knowledge, and remaining open to
          feedback, I can constantly enhance my skills and deliver high-quality
          results. Moreover, I recognize that effective communication is vital
          for collaborating with team members and stakeholders, ensuring the
          success of software engineering projects. With this mindset, I am
          confident in my ability to thrive in the dynamic and ever-evolving
          field of software engineering.

        <p>
          Hi! Welcome to MealMate, my own clone of Yelp. To bring MealMate to
          life, I utilized React for the frontend and Ruby on Rails for the
          backend. With this application, users have the ability to browse for
          restaurants, filter them according to price, and even post their own
          reviews of their dining experiences.

        <p>
          Leetcommit is a tool that connects a user's LeetCode and GitHub
          accounts and automatically commits their LeetCode solutions to a
          designated GitHub repository. The user first authenticates their
          GitHub account using GitHub OAuth and their LeetCode account using the
          CSRF token and session token. Once authenticated, Leetcommit uses
          GitHub Actions to sync the user's LeetCode solutions to their GitHub
          repository at regular intervals, with the current frequency set to
          every hour. This tool is intended to simplify the process of
          committing LeetCode solutions to GitHub and help users track their
          progress and development over time.
