        <h2 style="color: rgb(66, 133, 244)">About</h2>
        <p>
          Through my extensive experience as a gamer, specifically my
          decade-long engagement with League of Legends, I have developed an
          immense fascination with all facets of computing. The game's highly
          competitive environment and the continual need to acquire knowledge
          and skills every season have been instrumental in shaping my interest
          in the field. As a software engineer, I place significant emphasis on
          the importance of continuous learning and growth, and the famous maxim
          "adapt or die," attributed to Darwin, serves as a guiding principle
          that resonates with me on a personal level.
        </p>

        <p>
          While I initially had to take a brief hiatus from college due to the
          COVID-19 pandemic, I did not let this setback deter me from pursuing
          my passion for coding. My time at App Academy, which culminated in my
          graduation in March 2023, has allowed me to hone my expertise in Ruby
          on Rails and React-Redux, and I am excited to leverage these
          proficiencies in a professional setting.
        </p>

        <p>
          I firmly believe that cultivating a balance of passion and
          coachability is a critical aspect of succeeding as a software
          engineer. As someone who is deeply passionate about software
          development, I am always eager to augment my knowledge and refine my
          abilities while remaining receptive to constructive feedback. In
          addition, I recognize the significance of effective communication in
          software engineering, and I prioritize clear and efficient
          communication with all stakeholders.

        <p>
          Hi! Welcome to MealMate, my own clone of Yelp. To bring MealMate to
          life, I utilized React for the frontend and Ruby on Rails for the
          backend. With this application, users have the ability to browse for
          restaurants, filter them according to price, and even post their own
          reviews of their dining experiences.
